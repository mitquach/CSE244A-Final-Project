Initial pass at incorporating unlabeled data.  Batch size of 100 on the unlabeled data, with
an additional penalty factor on the derived loss to try to reduce any negative impact (very
early results suggested pseudo-label prediction and use could tank the model's performance pretty hard).
Unlabeled data was also only incorporated into the training after several epochs had passed, so that the
prediction accuracy we we're building from would already be high.

The results here don't seem that impressive.  After 20 epochs, the best model (according to the validation
set) was achieved at epoch 5.
