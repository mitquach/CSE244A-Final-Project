These are some experiments tied to splitting the leaf and dog data up, and training separate models
for each of the two categories before recombining their predictions.  The approach is rather crude
(I train two models, one on each dataset, but over the full list of output categories, then just
try to average the predictions of those two models in different ways for the output).  Not too much
work went into this because I didn't expect any surprises here; rather, I expected each model to
suffer from having less training data.  One thing that did come out of this was some confirmation
that it's easier to train models to high accuracy on leaves than on dogs.  That wasn't much of a
surprise given the imbalance in the number of output categories, but it was nice to see confirmed.
