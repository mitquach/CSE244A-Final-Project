This is just a bit of code to incorporate a secondary training set for tomato leaves from
https://github.com/mamta-joshi-gehlot/Tomato-Village.  In particular, we're interested in the
variant-a set, which is a single-label multi-class set that has significant overlap with the
categories we're trying to predict for the project.
