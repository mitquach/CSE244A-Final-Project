This is just a bit of code to incorporate a secondary training set for tomato leaves from
https://github.com/mamta-joshi-gehlot/Tomato-Village.  In particular, we're interested in the
variant-a set, which is a single-label multi-class set that has significant overlap with the
categories we're trying to predict for the project.

The tomato*.py files are attempts to incorporate the tomato data into our models in useful ways.
Ultimately they didn't make much of a difference, and didn't seem to help at all.
