These are some early experiments from using the augmentation techniques used in the Deit III paper
(a combination of gaussian blur, solarization, and greyscale image adjustment, along with a few
other basic modifications) to expand the dataset.

In deit3_augment, I also attempted to take advantage of the unlabeled data in an iterative way.
After waiting a few generations for the overall accuracy to go over 90%, I began generating
pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and then training the model on it - effectively trying to pull
myself up by my own bootstraps.  Unfortunately this wasn't very effective; the model tended to
decohere instead and just reinforce its own mistakes before descending into chaos.  In later
attempts, I switched to using a static set of pseudo-labels as generated from an earlier,
high-performing trained model.
